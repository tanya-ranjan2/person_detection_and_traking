<h3><b>Title :</b></h3>
The title is not an abbreviation, it's basically saying 'I see you' in a shot hand -> 'ICU'. This was done intentionally to make the project title fun and stand out. The title makes perfect sense as it works on computer vison and identifies and looks for people.

<h3><b>Problem Statement :</b></h3>
The problem that we identified was that there has been a lot of times when you have been to a mall or to a mart, just to have a look or to put it in a better way, to window-shop. Our objective was to help these owners identify at what time periods are the these people coming in. We can always count the number of customers by cross referencing the billing data, but how do you count the people who haven't shopped?

<h3><b>Solution:</b></h3>
Computer Vison, our main objective was to count the number of people through the CCTV cameras present in the area. The camera is going to send the feed to our algorithm and the data is processed and classified by it. Once it detects a person it then sees if he has gone into the shop or not. This will help us make a count of all the people visiting that mall or mart for that day.


<h3><b>Future Prospects:</b></h3>
This study and algorithm can be further applied to make a robust security system and prevent crimes in public areas. The applications are endless and the sky is the limit.
