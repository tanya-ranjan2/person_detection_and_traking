<h3><b>Title :</b></h3>
The title is not an abbreviation, it's basically saying 'I see you' in a shot hand -> 'ICU'. This was done intentionally to make the project title fun and stand out. The title makes perfect sense as it works on computer vison and identifies and looks for people.

<h3><b>Problem Statement :</b></h3>
The problem that we identified was that there has been a lot of times when you have been to a mall or to a mart, just to have a look or to put it in a better way, to window-shop. Our objective was to help these owners identify at what time periods are the these people coming in. We can always count the number of customers by cross referencing the billing data, but how do you count the people who haven't shopped?

<h3><b>Solution:</b></h3>
Computer Vison, our main objective was to count the number of people through the CCTV cameras present in the area. The camera is going to send the feed to our algorithm and the data is processed and classified by it. Once it detects a person it then sees if he has gone into the shop or not. This will help us make a count of all the people visiting that mall or mart for that day.

<h3><b>Questions that we wanted to answer:</b></h3>

- Once we have the data of all the people entering the mart/ mall on that day, comparing it to the billing
data will help tell us what number of people came in to window-shop (or how we put it 'For the cool
air') and how many of them were genuine customers.

- We can even split it according to time of the day or on an hourly basis to work to get greater insights,
which will help the mall/ mart owners to make better business decisions.

<h3><b>Future Prospects:</b></h3>
This study and algorithm can be further applied to make a robust security system and prevent crimes in public areas. The applications are endless and the sky is the limit.

<h3><b>Tech Stack Used : </b></h3>
- Python [Numpy, Matplotlib, OpenCV, ImageAI,Streamlit( for Webapp)]
