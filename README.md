Work with video data as every supermarket nowadays has at least one CCTV camera installed. And the data is stored in a centralised repository with a timestamp. Identify the people coming in and going, and categorise them under the customer and not a customer. We could calculate the actual cost per customer. Our workflow was split into 2 parts,
1. to optimise the video and make it as light as possible for the algorithm to work smoothly
2. human object detection
Tech Stack Used : Python, Numpy, Matplotlib, OpenCV, ImageAI,Streamlit( for Webapp)
